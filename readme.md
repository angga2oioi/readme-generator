# README

## Overview

The `readme-generator` project is a Node.js command-line tool designed to automatically generate a `README.md` file for a given directory. It uses OpenAI's language model to create descriptive content based on the directory's structure and the contents of its files.

## Features

- Reads a project's directory structure and files.
- Generates a comprehensive `README.md` file.
- Utilizes OpenAI's API for natural language content generation.
- Ignores files and directories specified in `.gitignore`.

## Usage
To use the `readme-generator`, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. Once installed, you can generate a README by running:

```bash
npx github:angga2oioi/readme-generator
```

The tool will prompt you to provide:
- `directory`: The path to the project's directory.
- `Open AI Config`: Your OpenAI configuration in JSON format, you can also use your own custom openai credential:

  ```json
  {
    "baseURL":"YOUR_BASE_URL",
    "apiKey": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
  }
  ```
The generated README file will be saved in the specified directory as `readme.md`.

## File Structure

- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application, initiates the README generation process.
- `lib/`: Contains library files performing various tasks:
  - `files.js`: Handles reading and writing of files; respects rules in `.gitignore`.
  - `main.js`: Contains logic to generate the README content using the directory's structure and file content.
  - `openai.js`: Interfaces with OpenAI's API and handles data chunking for API requests.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored (e.g., `node_modules/`, `.env`).
- `package.json`: Contains metadata such as package name, version, main file, and dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: Auto-generated file used to lock the versions of the dependencies.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following npm packages:

- `ignore`: Used for parsing `.gitignore` files to exclude specified files and directories.
- `jaci`: A utility for building interactive CLI applications in JavaScript and CoffeeScript.
- `openai`: Client for OpenAI APIs, used for generating the README content.
